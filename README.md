### Hi there. I am Preet Shah.

What makes me as a person feel alive are problems. Looking at problems, finding a solution is what drives me. Solving a problem, or just getting close to solving it gives me a different kind of rush. In life, we all need something that drives us.

I decided to become a software engineer when I was in the 6th grade when I was playing GTA Vice City and I was like "If playing this makes me so happy, imagine making one." Even though, I started out on a journey of becoming a game developer, I realized that games may only be an escape from the problems. But solving actual problems is what I want to do my entire life. Here I am after quite a long journey, almost a software engineer.

I am a detail-oriented, organized, dedicated, and thoughtful engineer, with a can-do attitude. I am always eager to learn something new.

My goal in life is to be an asset to my company and to be able to make a positive difference in the world. Helping people, being able to make a difference is what drives me.
